# Assignment 01 - Book Catalog 
Welcome to Zinna Kim's Book Catalog!
- A header section with the name of the app prominently displayed
- A content area displaying two books and a big Add button
- The UI for displaying a book should be implemented as a reusable component
It should have fixed width and height so that multiple books would be displayed perfectly aligned horizontally
- The book UI should display an image of the book, its authors and a link (HTML anchor element) to the book's details page (which opens in a new tab)
- The Add button can be styled as desired, but should be prominent and be the same width and height as the book component
- All the elements in the content area should be appropriately spaced
- A footer showing copyright information
