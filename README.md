# Assignment 01 - Book Catalog 
Welcome to Zinna Kim's Book Catalog!

This website features a header with the app name, a content area that displays books in a reusable, fixed-size component, and a prominent Add button styled to match the book cards. Each book shows its cover image, authors, and a link that opens the details page in a new tab, with all elements neatly aligned and spaced. A footer at the bottom displays copyright information.
